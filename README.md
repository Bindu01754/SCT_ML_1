House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Project Description:

This project builds a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on selected housing features. The model analyzes historical housing data and demonstrates essential steps of a regression workflow, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and visualization. The project provides hands-on understanding of how basic regression models can be applied to real estate price estimation.

Key Highlights:

Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas

Handling missing values for selected features

Feature selection (GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath)

Train–test dataset splitting

Model training using Scikit-learn Linear Regression

Model performance evaluation using R² score

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Technologies & Libraries:

Python
